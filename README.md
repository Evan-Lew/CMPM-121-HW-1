<p>My scene is a little farmhouse surrounded by hills. I started with the idea of wanting to make my own terrain, and I knew I wanted
some buildings which led me to find these two farm type of houses. After seeing those houses on the Unity store I got inspired to make 
a scene inspired by the book Animal Farm. I added various types of rocks and trees to make the environment more filled out. Next to the 
houses I added boxes, crates, a broom, and more to make the house more lived in. Lastly, I added the animals. The pig is the main character 
because it is on a box giving what it seems like a speech to the rest of the animals. In my head the pig is talking about how all the animals have to escape the farm before they turn into the goathead, which is hanging on one of the houses.</p>
